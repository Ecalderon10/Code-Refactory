# Code-Refactory: 01 Html, CSS, and Git

##Switched Div over to Semantic Elements and Dry coded CSS

In this code I cleaned up everything and made sure it was orginized properly


1.Title was given a new name 

2. Changed the size of the header

3.Alternatives where added to images just in case the image was broken

4.Rulesets in CSS were condensed due to repititative qualities

5.Css and html were corrected to the proper symantic elements

6. Comments were left in order to give a descriptive nature to what was changed
